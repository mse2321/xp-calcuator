Experience point calculator for table-top RPG games

This is a project that came about when friends of mine wanted a better way to calculate game experience points.
It is a simple calculator that tells you your new XP total and how much more you need to reach the next level.
In addition, it stores your information throughtout your game for easy, continued use.

In a future update, I will add the option to store multiple characters and add campaign names to help sort them.
